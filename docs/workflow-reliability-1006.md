# Workflow reliability rollout (#1006)

This document is the compatibility ledger for the reliability work. Each
tranche is independently deployable and is stacked on the previous one; an
operator can stop at any boundary without rewriting existing run records.

## Context contract (tranche A)

Every newly created in-process run carries `execution_context.version = 1`.
The record identifies:

- the Iterion run store (`run_store`), separately from business stores;
- the declared workspace isolation mode and logical workspace id;
- the compiled workflow revision, source root and optional bundle revision;
- root/parent run and parent-node lineage;
- the policy (`legacy`, `report`, or the future `enforce` gate).

The record contains identities and revisions only. It never stores credentials,
prompts, model output or business payloads. Older run documents omit the field
and remain readable; resume keeps the legacy behaviour until an admission
policy is explicitly enabled.

## Launch-surface matrix

| Surface | Context persisted | Admission owner | Planned tranche |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| local/API in-process launch | yes | runview service | A/B |
| local resume | existing context preserved | runview + runtime | B/C |
| detached launch | compatibility stamp | detached runner | B |
| cloud queued launch | queue/document propagation | publisher/runner | B |
| subbot child | parent/root reconciliation | runview subbot runner | B |
| watcher/Copi observation | diagnostic projection | watcher authority | F/G |

This matrix is intentionally explicit: a green unit test in one launch path is
not evidence that a queued or nested launch has the same context.

## Bounded invalid-output correction (tranche D)

Schema-invalid output is corrected only when the executor implements the
optional `runtime.OutputCorrector` capability. The engine allows at most the
configured budget (two calls by default, or `WithOutputCorrectionBudget(0)` to
disable it) for each node episode. Artifacts, events and outgoing edges are
written only after a corrected payload validates.

The episode ledger is persisted on the run document. It records the attempt
count, output/violation fingerprints and a terminal status (`succeeded`,
`exhausted` or `unchanged`). A corrector returning the same invalid payload is
stopped immediately, and a resume continues the existing budget rather than
starting a new loop. Executors must keep correction side-effect free; publish
and external-effect nodes remain behind the validation boundary.
